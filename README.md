hi I'm G (she/her)
I'm using git for a project at school. 
I'm more interested in hardware than software but I really like open source stuff.
I don't know much about programming but I'm learning and I mostly use github to find code for personal stuff like firefox hardening and web design stuff
I might contribute to things in the future but for now I'm just learning how to code.
